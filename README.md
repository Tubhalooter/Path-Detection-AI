# Path-Detection-AI
A path detection AI as part of an automated rover project, here is some of the tinkering with different models exploring their tradeoffs between model size to accuracy, since the intention was to run this on a raspberry pi ram usage was a very important factor. Unet preformed best for the Ram limitations but its accuracy was lackluster compared to Mask-RCNN trained on the same dataset. If provided more data , i believe Unet would be able to acheive a better Cost/performance ratio.

As of Right now the project has come to a standstill.
